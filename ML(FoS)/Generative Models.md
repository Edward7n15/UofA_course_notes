- discriminative models
	- $p(t|x)$
	- testing X as known constants
	- always given in both training and inference
	- no need to generate x
		- no need to have $P(x)$
	- learn the boundary
- generative models
	- $P(t,x)=P(x)\cdot P(t|x)=P(t)\cdot P(x|t)$
	- learn how the sample are generated
		- the distribution
	- purposes
		- to generate samples
			- when you have few samples
		- data augmentation
		- unsupervised learning
			- if t is unknown 
				- discriminative model 
					- ill-defined
				- generative model
					- $P(x)=\sum_tP(t,x)=\sum_t P(t)\cdot P(x|t)$

# Linear Least Squares Problems
Take many measurements to smooth out measurement errors or other random variations.

Seek a lower dimensional approximation to some higher dimensional object.
- smoothing out errors
- ignoring irrelevant details

#Overdetermined system: more equations than unknowns

minimize 2-norm of the residual vector $r=b-Ax$
- $Ax\overset\sim=b$

#Data_Fitting == #Curve_Fitting: given m data points (ti, yi) find the #Model_Function f(t,x)

If we have 5 data points (ti, yi)
- x are the parameters
- list all points to match the parameter so they can create the solution y

# Existence and Uniqueness
For #Square_Systems , in Ax=b, b can always be expressed as a linear combination of the columns of A.
For #Overdetermined Systems, only when $b\in span(A)$, which is highly unlikely in most application.
- we merely looking for the closest match possible in the 2-norm but not an exact match

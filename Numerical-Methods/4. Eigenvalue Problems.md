# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
$Ax=\lambda \cdot x$
- the equivalent of a matrix when multiplying a specific vector

Spectrum
- $\lambda(A)$
- set of all eigenvalues of A
	- as long as there is a eigenvector matching it, we don't care what it is

Spectral Radius
- $\rho(A)$
- $max\{|\lambda|:\lambda\in\lambda(A)\}$
	- the lambda with the largest absolute value in the spectrum

Through a transformation, eigenvectors remain their directions and will be shrink or expanded by their associated eigenvalue.

# Characteristic Polynomial
$Ax=\lambda x \rightarrow (A-\lambda I)x=0$
- Eigenvalues become the roots of the Characteristic Polynomial $det(A-\lambda I)=0$
- n by n matrix always has n eigenvalues, but they may not be real nor distinct
	- like $f=(x-a)^2(x-b)$
	- $a$ has multiplicity 2
	- $b$ is a simple eigenvalue

Defective eigenvalue: geometric multiplicity less than algebraic multiplicity
- alg mul
	- multiplicity as a root
- geo mul
	- number of linearly independent eigenvectors
	- never exceed its alg mul, but might be less than

- $A-\lambda I$ is a ==polynomial==
	- solving the polynomial is how you find the eigenvalues

- sum the numbers and times 2/3
- the closest one won
	- utility
		- full prize - absolute difference

# Normal Form
![[Pasted image 20240417155530.png]]
- C dominates R
	- utility overall better

weakly dominance
- with equal AND better utilities 
![[Pasted image 20240417162615.png]]Everyone will choose 1 because it is weakly dominate all other choices
- chain of reasoning

When there is no dominance, calculate the probability and the according utility.

Set the strategy of the opponent as an unknown

# Nash Equilibrium

- for both players, it's easy to find the dominance
- even though it's not the best solution

# population inference

sample $\rightarrow$ population 
- generalize the result from sample to population

require
- random selection of units (random sampling)

---
# causal inference

difference in response $\rightarrow$ difference in treatment

require
- random allocation of units to groups

---
# study designs and inferences

## observational studies
- pre-classified into different treatment groups
- ==no control== over who belongs in which group
	e.g. to study the difference in some characteristic between males and females, we won't randomly assign individuals to either male group or female group.

- causal inferences ==can not== be immediately made because there is no random allocation of units to groups

## randomized experiments

- random allocation of units to groups

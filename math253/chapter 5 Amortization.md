- Amortization method
	- the borrower repays the lender by installment payments at periodic intervals. This process is called “amortization’ of the loan
- sinking fund method
	- the borrower repays the lender by one lump-sum payment at the end of the term of the loan. The borrower pays interest on the loan in installments over this period. Furthermore, the borrower makes periodic payments into a fund, called a sinking fund, which will accumulate to the amount of the loan to be repaid at the end of the term of the loan.

Total value of payments made = Value of the loan at the time the agreement is entered into

### Amortization
- Amount of the Loan = PV of the Annuity

$L=Ra_n\urcorner,i$
$R=\frac L{a_n\urcorner,i}$

### Methods for Calculating the Loan Balance
- Prospective
	- $B^p_t=Ra_{n-t}\urcorner,i=\frac L{a_n\urcorner,i}a_{n-t}\urcorner,i$
- Retrospective
	- $B^r_t=L(1+i)^t-Rs_t\urcorner,i=Ra_n\urcorner,i(1+i)^t-Rs_t\urcorner,i$

### Amortization Schema
- payment amount = interest paid + principal paid

$\because ia_n\urcorner,i=1-v^n$
$\therefore v^n$ is the rest of payment

- payment = 1
- interest paid = $ia_n\urcorner,i$
- principal paid = $v^n$
